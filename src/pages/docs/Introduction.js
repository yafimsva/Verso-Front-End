          Hello, I hope you find this template useful. AppStack React has been
          crafted on top of Bootstrap 4 and React. The included docs don't
          replace the official ones, but provide a clear view of all extended
          styles and new components that this template provides on top of
          Bootstrap 4.
        </p>

        <p>
          The docs includes information to understand how the theme is
          organized, how to make changes to the source code, and how to compile
          and extend it to fit your needs.
        </p>
